# Serverless Machine Learning for Titanic Dataset

You should include a README.md file in your github repo, explaining briefly what you built in lab1.

In this project we built a scalable serverless machine learning predictive system, consisting of a feature pipeline, a training pipeline, a batch inference pipeline, and a user interface (one for interactive querying, one as a dashboard).
